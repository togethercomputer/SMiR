Review each puzzle piece and look closely at their shapes, paying attention to the tabs (protrusions) and blanks (indents).\n2. Determine which edges of the pieces can match. For example, a tab on one piece should fit into a blank on another piece.\n3. Consider the overall shape of the complete puzzle. Typically, corner pieces have two straight edges, while edge pieces have one straight edge.\n4. Arrange the pieces, ensuring that all tabs and blanks align perfectly with adjacent pieces to form a coherent and complete image."
