Each quadrant is a 2x2 grid containing numbers from 1 to 4. You need to place these quadrants in a 4x4 grid in such a way that:\n    - Each row contains the numbers 1 to 4 without repetition.\n    - Each column contains the numbers 1 to 4 without repetition.\n    - Each 2x2 sub-grid (quadrant) also contains the numbers 1 to 4 without repetition.\n3. Start by looking for clues or patterns that help determine where each quadrant fits, ensuring that all rules are satisfied.\n4. Adjust the quadrants as needed until you achieve a valid 4x4 Sudoku grid."
