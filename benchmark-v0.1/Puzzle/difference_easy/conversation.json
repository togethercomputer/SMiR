Look for subtle changes such as variations in color, missing or added elements, differences in shapes, text alterations, or any other small adjustments that might be easy to overlook. Taking a systematic approach, such as examining the images from left to right and top to bottom, can help ensure that no differences are missed. Mark or list each difference as you identify them until you find all 10."
