Next, look at the tempo markings and any special playing instructions, such as dynamics or articulations, which can give insights into the intended mood. Examine the key signature, time signature, and overall form of the music (e.g., sonata, rondo). Analyze the melody, harmony, and rhythm to determine the piece's character and style. Pay attention to any recurring motifs or themes and how they evolve throughout the piece. Finally, consider how the technical aspects, such as fingering or phrasing, contribute to the expression and emotion conveyed by the music."
