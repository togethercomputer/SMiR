This approach humanizes historical figures, presenting them not just as subjects of history but as people with relatable challenges, beliefs, and moral dilemmas. Reflective narratives provide insight into the thoughts and motivations that drove these figures, offering a richer, more nuanced understanding of their actions and the impact they had on the world. This storytelling method encourages readers to reflect on their own values and actions, fostering a personal connection to the lessons and legacies of the past."
