Key areas include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and general relativity. It also involves advanced topics like quantum field theory, particle physics, string theory, condensed matter physics, and cosmology. Each of these topics explores different aspects of physical laws, from the behavior of subatomic particles to the dynamics of galaxies, using mathematical models and abstractions to predict and explain physical phenomena."
