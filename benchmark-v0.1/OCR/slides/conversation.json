A balanced diet tailored to the specific needs of the animals ensures they receive essential nutrients, which supports growth, immune function, and milk or meat production. Access to clean water is crucial for maintaining overall health, as it helps with digestion, temperature regulation, and waste elimination. Additionally, providing adequate shelter protects livestock from extreme weather conditions and predators. Regular veterinary care, including vaccinations and health check-ups, is also vital for preventing diseases and ensuring high productivity. Proper management practices, such as maintaining clean living environments and minimizing stress, further contribute to the well-being and efficiency of livestock."
