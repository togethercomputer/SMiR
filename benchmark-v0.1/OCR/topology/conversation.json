Key topics include the study of homotopy, homology, and cohomology theories, which provide ways to classify and analyze spaces based on their structural properties. The fundamental group, higher homotopy groups, and various types of homology groups (such as simplicial, singular, and cellular homology) are central concepts. These tools help in understanding spaces up to continuous deformations and in identifying invariants that distinguish different types of spaces."
