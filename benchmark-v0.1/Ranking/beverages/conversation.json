            "content": "Based on the criteria of hydration, health benefits, caffeine content, and suitability for all age groups, here is the ranking of the beverages from most to least suitable:\n\n1. **Water** - Water is the best option for hydration and overall health, containing no caffeine, sugar, or calories, making it ideal for individuals of all ages. It is crucial for bodily functions and widely recommended for maintaining optimal health.\n\n2. **Orange Juice** - Orange juice provides significant health benefits due to its high vitamin C content and antioxidants. It also hydrates, though it contains natural sugars. Itâ€™s generally suitable for all ages when consumed in moderation.\n\n3. **Coffee** - Coffee offers hydration along with caffeine, which can improve alertness and concentration. It contains antioxidants, but its suitability varies due to caffeine content, making it less ideal for young children and those sensitive to caffeine.\n\n4. **Soft Drink (Soda)** - While soda provides hydration, it comes with high sugar content and lacks nutritional value. It poses potential health risks, such as contributing to weight gain and dental problems, making it less suitable, especially for children.\n\n5. **Beer** - Beer contains alcohol, making it unsuitable for individuals under the legal drinking age and less appropriate for overall health. It does not contribute positively to hydration or health benefits and should be consumed responsibly by adults only.\n\nThis ranking considers the suitability of each beverage based on the prioritized criteria, offering insights into their respective benefits and limitations."
