It's accessible but can be high-impact on joints.\n\n2. **Cycling** - Offers excellent cardiovascular benefits with lower impact on joints compared to running. It's accessible with the right equipment.\n\n3. **Swimming** - Provides a full-body workout with great cardiovascular benefits and minimal joint impact. Accessibility depends on pool availability.\n\n4. **Weightlifting** - While primarily for strength, it can improve cardiovascular health when done with high intensity and short rest periods.\n\n5. **Yoga** - Offers moderate cardiovascular benefits, focusing more on flexibility and strength. It's low-impact and highly accessible.\n\nThis ranking evaluates the activities based on their suitability for improving cardiovascular health, emphasizing intensity, accessibility, and joint impact."
