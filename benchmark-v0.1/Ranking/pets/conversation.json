They provide companionship without demanding constant attention.\n\n2. **Fish** - Fish are low-maintenance and require minimal space. They are ideal for professionals who want a pet without the need for interaction or extensive care.\n\n3. **Rabbit** - Rabbits require moderate maintenance and space. They can be good companions but need regular care and attention.\n\n4. **Parrot** - Parrots offer companionship and can be interactive, but they require significant attention, social interaction, and space, which may not suit a busy lifestyle.\n\n5. **Dog** - Dogs are highly social and require regular exercise, attention, and space. They may not be ideal for busy professionals who cannot dedicate time to their care.\n\nThis ranking evaluates the pets based on their suitability for a busy professional, emphasizing maintenance, companionship, and lifestyle compatibility."
