For instance, the mural in Image 1 combines vibrant colors and iconic portraits, suggesting themes of diversity and empowerment. The seagull artwork in Image 2 uses scale and perspective, making the bird appear larger than life, which may symbolize freedom or the impact of urban life on nature. Image 3â€™s depiction of a protester throwing flowers, a common theme in Banksy's work, contrasts violent imagery with peaceful symbols, highlighting a critique of conflict and an advocacy for peace. In Image 4, the faceless figure adjusting a tie with chains for cufflinks suggests commentary on corporate greed or loss of individuality. Finally, the colorful leopard mural in Image 5 uses vibrant hues and intense eye contact to command attention, possibly representing power, vigilance, or a call for environmental conservation."
