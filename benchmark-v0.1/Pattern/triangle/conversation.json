Three of these quadrants contain yellow triangles within circles, each oriented differently within their respective quadrants. The top-left triangle points downward, the top-right triangle points upward, and the bottom-left triangle points to the right. The bottom-right quadrant is empty and marked with a question mark, indicating that the correct triangle orientation needs to be determined.\n\nThe options (a, b, c, d) each display a triangle inside a circle, with variations in the triangle's orientation: left, right, up, or down."

        "content": "To find the correct option that completes the missing part in the first image, let's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The triangles in the filled quadrants follow a rotational pattern:\n   - Top-left: Triangle points down.\n   - Top-right: Triangle points up (180-degree rotation from the first triangle).\n   - Bottom-left: Triangle points to the right (90-degree clockwise rotation from the second triangle).\n\n2. To complete the sequence, the missing triangle in the bottom-right quadrant should follow a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation from the bottom-left triangle.\n\n3. The correct triangle should point to the left.\n\nMatching this with the options:\n- **Option (a):** Triangle points to the left.\n- **Option (b):** Triangle points to the right.\n- **Option (c):** Triangle points up.\n- **Option (d):** Triangle points down.\n\nTherefore, **Option (a)** is the correct choice as it points the triangle to the left, fitting the rotational pattern."
