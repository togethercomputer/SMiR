The sequence starts with a single large circle on the left, then progresses to two smaller circles stacked vertically. The next pattern shows three circles stacked vertically. The final position has a question mark, indicating the need to determine the correct continuation of this sequence.\n\nThe options (a, b, c, d) show vertical stacks of green circles with increasing numbers of circles. Option (a) has three circles, option (b) has four circles, option (c) has five circles, and option (d) has eight circles."

It then progresses to two smaller circles stacked vertically.\n3. The next part of the sequence is three smaller circles stacked vertically.\n4. Following this pattern, the sequence increases by adding one more circle each time.\n\nTo complete the sequence, the next set should have four circles stacked vertically.\n\nMatching this with the options:\n- **Option (a):** Shows three circles, which matches the third step of the sequence, not the fourth.\n- **Option (b):** Shows four circles, which matches the correct next step in the sequence.\n- **Option (c):** Shows five circles, one step ahead of the required continuation.\n- **Option (d):** Shows eight circles, which significantly exceeds the pattern progression.\n\nTherefore, **Option (b)** is the correct choice as it has four circles, continuing the sequence with the correct number of circles."
