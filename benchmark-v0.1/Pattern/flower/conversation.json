Three of these quadrants have a petal-like shape that is filled with yellow and outlined in purple. The shapes are arranged in a specific orientation within each quadrant, and there is one quadrant that is empty, marked with a question mark, suggesting that something is missing or needs to be filled in according to the established pattern. \n\nEach option (a, b, c, d) shows a single petal-like shape inside a smaller square. The petals differ in their orientation and position within the square. The variations include differences in which side or corner of the square the petal points towards, and the curve direction of the petal."

For the bottom-left quadrant, the petal should also curve towards the center, which is correctly represented by option (b). This option places the petal in the bottom-left quadrant with the same inward curve as the others, completing the pattern."
