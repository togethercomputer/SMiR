Notice any distinct plumage patterns, markings, or color variations. Consider the habitat where these birds are commonly found, as well as any specific behaviors they exhibit, such as feeding habits or movement patterns. Using these observations, you can compare them to known characteristics of various bird species to accurately identify each one."
