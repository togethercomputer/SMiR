Notice any distinct plumage patterns, markings, or color variations, particularly on their tail feathers and body. Consider the habitat preferences where these turkeys are commonly found and any specific behaviors they exhibit, such as their display during mating or interactions with other turkeys. Using these observations, you can compare them to known characteristics of various turkey breeds to accurately identify each one."
