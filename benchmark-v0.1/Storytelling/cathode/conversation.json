        "content": "In the first image, we see a close-up of a person's arm with wires and electrodes taped to the skin, likely part of a medical procedure or experiment involving nerve stimulation or muscle control. The second image shows a person adjusting switches on a device labeled 'cathode' and 'anode,' which seems to be controlling the electrical stimulation related to the setup on the arm. The third image features a prosthetic hand, with sensors and wiring visible, being tested with a foam block, indicating that the prosthetic limb is being calibrated or tested for functionality. The fourth image shows two men shaking hands, one of them using the prosthetic hand seen earlier, suggesting that the device is operational and that the testing process is complete. Together, these images depict the development and testing of a prosthetic limb controlled by nerve stimulation or electrical signals, showcasing the technological and medical advancements in prosthetic design and functionality."

        "content": "These images highlight the intricate blend of technology and medical innovation involved in modern prosthetic development. The first image emphasizes the medical aspect, showing how nerve stimulation is directly harnessed to control the prosthetic limb. The use of electrodes and wires on the person's arm demonstrates the connection between the nervous system and external devices, a critical advancement in improving the functionality of prosthetic limbs. The second image, showing the manipulation of electrical controls, suggests the fine-tuning needed to ensure that the signals from the body are properly translated into movement. The third image, featuring the prosthetic hand in action, underscores the technological achievement of designing a limb that responds to nerve impulses, providing the user with a functional extension of their body. The final image, where a man successfully uses the prosthetic hand for a handshake, demonstrates the culmination of the process, showing that the procedure is effective and that the prosthetic is able to perform real-world tasks. The progression from nerve stimulation to prosthetic movement illustrates the effectiveness of this cutting-edge approach in restoring physical capabilities to individuals with limb loss."
